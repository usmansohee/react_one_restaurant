# Getting Started with Create React App

This project was bootstrapped with [Create React App](https://github.com/facebook/create-react-app).


# Learned Topics
** Directory Structure
** react basics
*** workflow
*** functional commponents (rules)
*** object map filter (es6)
*** arrow function (called arrow function onClick for avoiding repttation calls)
## start

Install the Recommended version of NodeJS


Click Node JS


check the version of NodeJS node -v on cmd

What is React?

Install React JS in our system using " npx create-react-app app_name "

Go to the main directory by typing cd app_name

How to run the React Project 🤔 Oooo It's simple
just write the npm or yarn start command

Understand the folder Structure

Remove the Boiler Plate

What's New in React 17th Version? We will see it after our first component.

Vs Code Extension to make our React life Easy
VS Code JavaScript (ES6) snippets

ES7 React/Redux/GraphQL/React-Native snippets

Hello World In React JS

Our First Component in React JS
Three things are mandatory & that are
import React from "react"
any one function (functional Component)
It should always return JSX.

After React 17.0 Version, Now no need to write
import React from "react" Anymore

What is JSX? Rules to write JSX.
It always return single element

use Div or React Fragment to wrap all your JSX Code

ClassName in place of class

Need to close all non closing Tags in JSX

Use camelCase for attributes

Autocomplete for React JSX 😍 Very Important
Open the settings

Open Setting(JSON) file located on Top Right Corner

Add the following Code => "emmet.includeLanguages": {"javascript": "javascriptreact"},

What is Nested Components?

CSS in React JS

Props in React JS

Props Children????

JS important Methods
Map Method

Spread Operator & Many More

## Available Scripts

In the project directory, you can run:

### `npm start`

Runs the app in the development mode.\
Open [http://localhost:3000](http://localhost:3000) to view it in your browser.

The page will reload when you make changes.\
You may also see any lint errors in the console.

### `npm test`

Launches the test runner in the interactive watch mode.\
See the section about [running tests](https://facebook.github.io/create-react-app/docs/running-tests) for more information.

### `npm run build`

Builds the app for production to the `build` folder.\
It correctly bundles React in production mode and optimizes the build for the best performance.

The build is minified and the filenames include the hashes.\
Your app is ready to be deployed!

See the section about [deployment](https://facebook.github.io/create-react-app/docs/deployment) for more information.

### `npm run eject`

**Note: this is a one-way operation. Once you `eject`, you can't go back!**

If you aren't satisfied with the build tool and configuration choices, you can `eject` at any time. This command will remove the single build dependency from your project.

Instead, it will copy all the configuration files and the transitive dependencies (webpack, Babel, ESLint, etc) right into your project so you have full control over them. All of the commands except `eject` will still work, but they will point to the copied scripts so you can tweak them. At this point you're on your own.

You don't have to ever use `eject`. The curated feature set is suitable for small and middle deployments, and you shouldn't feel obligated to use this feature. However we understand that this tool wouldn't be useful if you couldn't customize it when you are ready for it.
